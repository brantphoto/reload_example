# Your First Gulp project with LiveReload 

First things first I'm going on the assumption that you have node installed. If not, this might be a perfect time to do so. I recommend using the package installer on the [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) site as it makes it much easier. I could go into more detail, but for now I'll just say I don't like where the homebrew installer of Node puts certain files 

With node installed via the installer you now should have access to both the node and npm bash commands. We're going to be using npm.

The first thing we're going to want to do is create our project directory and change into that directory. We can do this with the following. The

`mkdir gulpreload`

`cd gulpreload`

`npm init` 

```npm install gulp gulp-livereload --save-dev```
